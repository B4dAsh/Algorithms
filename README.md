# Algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms I've come across in my short journey as a Computer Science student. Since I'm still very much of a rookie, these might not be the most efficient or the best implementations.

## List of Algorithms

### Maths
* Sieve of Eratosthenes
* Operations on Matrices
* Areas of Geometrical Shapes

### Searches
* [Linear Search](https://github.com/B4dAsh/Algorithms/blob/main/Python/searches/linear_search.py)
* [Binary Search](https://github.com/B4dAsh/Algorithms/blob/main/Python/searches/binary_search.py)

### Sorts
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort

### Crypto
* Caesar Cipher (Encoder and decoder)
* ROT13

### Miscellaneous
* [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/B4dAsh/Algorithms/blob/main/Python/palindrome.py)
* [Reversion](https://github.com/B4dAsh/Algorithms/blob/main/Python/reversion.py)
* [Assertion](https://github.com/B4dAsh/Algorithms/blob/main/Python/assertion.py)

I'll be updating this list as I add more and more algorithms to this repository...

## Afterthoughts

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Š
