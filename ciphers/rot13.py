        A modification of Caesar Cipher where each alphabet is shifted 
        13 places meaning the same algorithm can be used to encrypt as 
        well as decrypt the text. This change from Caesar Cipher - which 
        already a weak standard, makes ROT13 even weaker choice. Probably, 
        the only benefit of using it may have been that one didn't need to 
        remember the key.
