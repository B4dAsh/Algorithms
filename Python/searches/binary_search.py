        Binary Search - O(logn) / Î©(1).

        Binary search requires a sorted array. On first iteration middle element is selected
        as the pivotal element.

        On each subsequent iteration:
            * Check If the pivot is equal to the value being searched, Terminate if it is and return the index of pivot.
            * Else if pivotal element is smaller than value being searched then continue the loop by 
            selecting a new pivot in the array which neglects all elements equal to or smaller than the current pivot.
            * Else if the pivotal element is greater than the value continue loop by selecting a new pivot 
            in the array which neglects all the elements equal to or greater than the current pivot.
            * In case the array is divided until there's only a single element left which is not equal to the value,
            it means that the element is not in the array and -1 is returned.

        Binary Search, on each subsequent iteration divides the array in half and hence it is much efficient than Linear
        search where all the elements are checked one by one.
