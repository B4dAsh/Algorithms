        Binary Search.
        Time complexity - O(logn) | Î©(1)
        Space complexity - O(n)

        Binary search requires a sorted array. On first iteration middle 
        element is selected as the pivotal element.

        On each subsequent iteration:
            * Check If the pivot is equal to the value being searched
            Terminate if it is and return the index of pivot.
            * Else if pivotal element is smaller than value being searched 
            then continue the loop by selecting a new pivot in the array 
            which neglects all elements equal to or smaller than the 
            current pivot.
            * Else if the pivotal element is greater than the value 
            continue loop by selecting a new pivot in the array which 
            neglects all the elements equal to or greater than the current 
            pivot.
            * In case the array is divided until there's only a single 
            element left which is also not equal to the value, it means 
            that the element is not in the array and -1 is returned.

        Binary Search, on each subsequent iteration divides the array in 
        half and hence it is much efficient than Linear
        search where all the elements are checked one by one.
