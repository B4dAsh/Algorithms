        Recursive Binary Search.

        Recursive binary search, just like normal binary search requires a 
        sorted array. On first iteration middle element is selected as the 
        pivotal element.

        On each subsequent iteration:
            * Check If the pivot is equal to the value being searched
            Terminate if it is and return the index of pivot.
            * Else if pivotal element is smaller than value being searched 
            then run binary search again while neglecting all elements
            equal or smaller than the pivot.
            * Else if the pivotal element is greater than the value 
            run binary search neglecting all elements equal to greater than
            the pivot.
            * In case the array is divided until it consists of only one
            element left which is also not equal to the value, it means 
            that the element is not in the array and -1 is returned.

        Binary Search, on each subsequent iteration divides the array in 
        half and hence it is much efficient than Linear
        search where all the elements are checked one by one.
        While this recursive implementation does not provide
        any fundamental advantage over iterative approach, we do it because
        recursion is cool! :p
